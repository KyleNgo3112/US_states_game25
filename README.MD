This project is an interactive U.S. states guessing game built using Python's turtle graphics library and pandas for handling state data. The objective is for users to guess all 50 U.S. states by name. When a correct guess is made, the state's name is displayed on a map of the United States.

Features:
- Interactive graphical game using turtle.
- Tracks correct guesses and displays them on a map.
- Allows users to exit the game early and generates a CSV file of states they still need to learn.
